# COVID19-Machine-Learning-Model
Final Year Project of GROUP 23

## Clinical Data Analysis
* Xgboost -> (Train : 93.81% ,  Test : 87.01%)
* SVM + Lasso ->  (Train : 99.68% ,  Test : 100%)
* SVM + Lasso + Feature Count ->  (Train : 94.09% ,  Test : 94.79%)
#### Overfitting issue if observed when we use Lasso & SVM , used Feature count Method to Overcome it
